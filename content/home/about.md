# Biography

I am an enterprising and creative,different from the others and eager to fulfill my dreams and illusions. Born in a mediterranean city, Tarragona, I love the nature and the peace of the sea at the same time I adore the new technologies and frameworks that make this world easy for every body. My dream is work some day for a big company who give me the opportunity to take part of their projects to improve this world and change the people arround it. I love be friendly and get out with my friends at the weekends, and as a practitioner of Aikido I respect a lot the people and I work very well with small groups of people. I have work developping and deploing web apps with Django and Ruby on Rails following the MVC Pattern.
